# reactplayground

This is a playground for my React adventures. Hopefully this repo will demonstrate some of the following when I'm done:

_In progress_

* how to structure an application
* compiling with [babel](http://babeljs.io/) to provide at least ES6 support
* building with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* isomorhpic react app using [express](http://expressjs.com/)

_Future_

* usage of flux pattern with [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* potentially other JS lanagages such as [purescript](http://www.purescript.org/)
* code re-use for [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* code re-use for desktop app using [elektron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* maybe even a [TODO app](http://todomvc.com/)... who knows

To be continued....
