# reactplayground

This is a playground for my React learnings. Hope fully will demonstrate the following when I'm done:

* how to structure a application
* compiling with babel to provide at least ES6 support
* building with webpack
* isomorhpic react app using express
* usage of flux pattern with redux
* potentially other JS lanagages such as purescript
* 
* maybe even a TODO app.. who knows

To be continued
