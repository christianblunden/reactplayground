# reactplayground

This is a playground for my React learnings. Hope fully will demonstrate the following when I'm done:

_In progress_

* how to structure an application
* compiling with babel to provide at least ES6 support
* building with webpack
* isomorhpic react app using express

_Future_

* usage of flux pattern with redux
* potentially other JS lanagages such as purescript
* code re-use for react-native
* code re-use for desktop app using elektron
* maybe even a TODO app... who knows

To be continued
