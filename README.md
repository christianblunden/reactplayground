# reactplayground

This is a playground for my React adventures. Hopefully this repo will demonstrate some of the following when I'm done:

_In progress_

* how to structure an application
* compiling with [babel](http://babeljs.io/) to provide at least ES6 support
* building with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* isomorhpic react app using [express](http://expressjs.com/)
* usage of flux pattern with [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* maybe even a [TODO app](http://todomvc.com/)... who knows

_Future_

* use isomorhpic react-router
* potentially other JS lanagages such as [purescript](http://www.purescript.org/)
* code re-use for [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* code re-use for desktop app using [elektron](http://electron.atom.io/)

To be continued....

## Getting Started

To run this app, ensure you have at least the latest LTS version of node (v6.9.4 at time of writing), and the latest npm (v4.1.1 at time of writing).

```bash
npm install
npm run build
DEBUG=reactplayground npm start
```
